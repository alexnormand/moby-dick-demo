      The drama's done. Why then here does any one step forth?â€”Because one
      did survive the wreck.
    </p><p>
      It so chanced, that after the Parsee's disappearance, I was he whom the
      Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab's bowsman, when that bowsman
      assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three men
      were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So, floating
      on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the
      halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly,
      drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a
      creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting towards the
      button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like
      another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital centre, the black
      bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring,
      and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin
      life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side.
      Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on
      a soft and dirgelike main. The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with
      padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks.
      On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It
      was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her
      missing children, only found another orphan.
